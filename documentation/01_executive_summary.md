# Executive Summary (Glue Version)

This Glue-based data engineering pipeline implements a production-grade ELT analytics system that ingests, validates, standardizes, and transforms 9.1 GB of highly inconsistent e-commerce data into reliable, analytics-ready datasets. The platform automates the complete data lifecycle—from S3 RAW ingestion through curated GOLD datasets—using event-driven Airflow ingestion, AWS Glue Spark jobs for large-scale transformation, and Amazon Redshift Serverless as the serving layer.
The system is designed to support data analysts, BI teams, and downstream consumers by ensuring that behavioral events, user records, and transaction data are processed with strict schema enforcement, schema-drift resilience, centralized data quality validation, SCD-style user history handling in the Silver layer, and quarantine-based error isolation. This approach guarantees deterministic, reproducible outputs while preventing corrupt or malformed data from contaminating analytical tables.
This Glue Edition emphasizes enterprise reliability and scalability through clear separation of concerns: Airflow manages orchestration and dependency control, Glue Spark jobs handle all transformation and modeling logic, and Redshift Serverless provides a scalable, low-maintenance analytics warehouse. The resulting Gold-layer dimensions, facts, and marts are rebuilt deterministically per run, enabling downstream teams to confidently build dashboards, run ad-hoc queries, and perform business analysis without operational complexity or data correctness risks.
